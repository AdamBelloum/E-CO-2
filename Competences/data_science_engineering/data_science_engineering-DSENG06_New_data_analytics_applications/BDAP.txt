Many data scientists don’t have degrees in busin
ess. To be effective, however, they need to understand the specific 
industry  and  organization  in  which  they  work.  To  make  up  for  this  potential  deficiency,  it  is  common  to  have  data 
scientists work closely with people in the organization who have business 
domain knowledge.
Big  data  analytics  users  make  up  a  continuum.  The  reason  is  that  there  are  users  all  along  the  continuum.  For 
example, some end users become power users in their departments and perform analyst roles such as developing 
reports  for  other  u
sers. 
Other
analysts  further  develop  their  skills  and  are  able  to  perform  some  of  the  tasks 
associated with data scientists, especially when provided analytical workbenches like SAS Enterprise Miner and IBM 
SPSS Modeler.
Appendix  A  describes  how  universiti
es,  companies,  and  vendors  are  responding  to  meet  the  demand  for  people 
skilled in the use of big data analytics.
VIII. BIG DATA AND P
RIVACY
The collection, storage, and mining of big data will only increase. A big data issue that is gaining attention and 
will 
beco
me  more  important  is  individual  privacy:  What  data  should  the  government  and  organizations  be  allowed  to 
collect and what safeguards should be in place about how it is used? The Target story provides a glimpse into the 
uses that make some 
people
u
ne
asy. Other  people see no  problem with this use of big data
,
because it results in 
better customer
service and appealing offers. 
In 
the 
summer 
of 
2013,  there  were  numerous  news  stories  about  Edward  Snowden,  a  former  CIA  employee  and 
NSA consultant, who r
evealed secrets about how the U.S. government was tracking private individuals’ phone calls 
and  using  this  information.  Many  people,  especially  in
the  government,  viewed  Snowden  as  a  traitor  who 
jeopardized the country’s national security in the fight agai
nst  terrorism
;
others  saw  him  as  a  whistle
-
blower  who 
informed the public about a practice t
hat threatens civil liberties. 
Clemons
et al. [2014] identify three different ways to characterize privacy  and online invasions of privacy. The first 
way  is  an  uni
nvited intrusion into a user’s p
ersonal  space.  This  includes  online  marketing,  spam  advertising,  pop
-
ups,  and  sponsored  sites  around  the  edges  of  a  Web  page.  In  their  study,  most  people  see  this  is  as  the  most 
salient 
type 
of  privacy  invasion,  even  though 
its  potential  consequences  are  the  least  harmful.  The  most  serious 
threats  are  fraudulent  e
-
commerce  transactions  and  identity  theft.  Although  these  are  concerns,  people  are  not 
worried  that  these  kinds  of  activities  would 
be 
perpetrated 
by
big  data  compan
ies  like  Google  and  Facebook. The 
third  kind  of  invasion  is  personal  profiling  for  commercial  advantage.  This  occurs  when  companies  like  Google, 
Facebook, and Yahoo! combine hundreds or thousands of pieces of data from different sources (i.e., data blendin
g) 
to  understand  who  you  are,  where  you  live,  where  you  go,  who  your  friends  are,  what  you  buy,  and  the  like.  This 
blended information may be used 
simply 
to
make offers that are likely to appeal to you, or for less benign purposes
such as knowing 
whether
y
ou  engage in risky hobbies and should be charged higher  insurance rates [Clemons et 
al., 2014].
Research shows that most people have very little understanding and concern about how organizations are using big 
da
ta  [Clemons
et  al.,  2014].  However,  as  indivi
duals  understand  the  potential  uses  better,  their  concerns  increase 
quickly. This sugg
ests that as companies increasingly use big data analytics on customer data, the public is l
ikely to 
become more concerned.
Although 
some laws
limit the activities of tel
ecommunications companies (e.g., they can’t listen to phone calls), 
few 
regulations  and  laws 
are 
applicable  for  the  new  digital  age  and  are  largely  non
-
existent  for  Internet  firms.  These 
companies  privacy  policies  largely  serve  their  commercial  interests  r
ather than protecting individuals’ privacy. We 
need  laws  about  individual  privacy  that  people  think  that  are  consistent,  reasonable,  transparent,  and  easy  to 
understand [Clemons et al., 2014].

. CONCLUSION
From  a  historical  perspective,  big  data  can  be 
viewed  as  the  latest  generation  in  the  evolution  of  decision  support 
data management [Watson and Marjanovic 2013c]. The need for  data to support computer
-
based decision  making 
has existed at least 
since the early 1970s with 
DSS
.  This period can be thought
of as the first generation of decision 
support data management. It was very application
-
centric
,
with data organized to support a single decision or a set 
of related decisions. By the 1990s, th
ere was a need to support a wide variety of BI and analytic ap
plications (e.g., 
reporting,  executive  information  systems)  with  data.  Having  separate  databases  (i.e.,  independent  data  marts)  for 
each  application  was  costly,  resulted  in  data  inconsistencies  across  applications,  and  failed  to  support  enterprise
-
wide  app
lications.  The  outcome  was  the  emergence  of 
enterprise  data  warehouses
, 
the  second  generation,  which 
represent
ed  a  data
-
centric  approach  to  data  management.  The 
third 
generation  was 
real
-
time  data  warehousing
. 
1264
Volume 34
Article 65
Technology had improved by 2000 so that it was
possible to capture data in real time and trickle
-
feed it into the data 
warehouse.  The  significance  of  this  evolution  is  that  it  changed  the  paradigm for  what  kinds  of  decisions  could  be 
supported.  With  real
-
time  data,  operational  decisions  and  processes 
could  be  supported. 
Big  data
is  the  fourth 
generation 
of 
decision  support  data  management.  The  ability  to  capture,  store,  and  analyze  high
-
volume,  high
-
velocity,  and  high
-
variety  data  is  allowing  decisions  to  be  supported  in  new  ways.  It  is  also  creating 
n
ew  data 
management challenges.
For many years, companies developed data warehouses as the focal point for data to support decision making. This 
is changing as new data sources, platforms, and cloud
-
based services emerge. As a result, data is becoming more 
federated
; that is, data is stored and accessed from multiple places. Adding to this trend are business units such as 
finance  and  marketing  that  have  the  business  need
s
,  resources,  and  political  clout  to  acquire  their  own  platforms, 
services,  and  tools.  In
many  organizations,  IT  is  losing  some  control  over  data  management.  This  is  not  bad  if  it 
leads to more agility and better organizational performance. The downside, however, includes data silos that don’t 
sha
re  data,  data  inconsistencies,  inefficiencies  i
n  storing  data,  and  duplication  of  resources.  Organizations  are 
accepting  that  data  federation  is  going  to  exist,  at  least  in  the  short  to  medium  term,  and  are  instituting  greater 
controls  over  their  data  management  practices.  Some  are  putting  more  emphasi
s  on  data  governance  (e.g.,  data 
stewards, metadata management, and master data management). They are also creating BI or analytics centers of 
excellence  to  provide  strategic  direction  for  the  use  of  data  and  analytics,  prioritize  projects,  provide  shareab
le 
resources, establish guidelines and standards, participate in tool selection, troubleshoot problems, and more.
Organizations  are  gaining  unprecedented  insights  into  customers  and  operations  because  of  the  ability  to  analyze 
new data sources and large vo
lumes of highly detailed data [Russom, 201
1
]. This data is bringing more context and 
insight  to  organizational  decision  making.  Success  with  big  data  is  not  guaranteed,  h
owever,  as  there  are  specific 
requirements that must be met. Organizations should star
t with specific, narrowly defined objectives, often related to 
better  understanding  and  connecting  with  customers  and  improving  operations.  There  must  be  strong,  committed 
sponsorship. Depending on the project(s), the sponsorship can be departmental or at 
the senior executive level. The 
CIO  is  typically  responsible  for  developing  and  maintaining  the  big  data  infrastructure.  For  some  companies  (e.g., 
Google), alignment bet
ween the business and IT strategies is second nature because big data is what the busin
ess 
is  all  about.  For  others,  careful  consideration  needs  to  be  given  to  organization  structure  issues;  governance;  the 
skills,  experiences,  and  perspectives  of  organizational  personnel;  how  business  needs  are  turned  into  successful 
projects; and more. The
re should be a fact
-
based decision
-
making
culture where the business is 
run by the numbers 
and there is constant experimentation to see what works best. The creation
and maintenance of this culture depends 
on  senior  management.  Big  data  has  spawned  a  varie
ty  of  new  data  management  technologies,  platforms,  and 
approaches.  These  must  be  blended  with  traditional  platforms 
such  as 
data  warehouses  in  a  way  that  meets 
organizational  needs  cost  effectively.  The  analysis  of  big  data  requires  traditional  tools  like 
SQL,  analytical 
workbenches 
like 
SAS  Enterprise  Miner
,
and  data  analysis  and  visualization  languages  like  R.  All  of  this  is  for 
naught, however, unless there are 
business users, analysts, and data scientists who can work with and use big data. 
As organizat
ions make greater use of big data, it is likely that there will be increased concerns and legislation abo
ut 
individual privacy issues.

APPENDIX A: MEETING 
THE DEMAND FOR PEOPL
E SKILLED IN BIG DAT
A ANALYTICS
As the McKinsey Global Institute and Gartner studies cited earlier show, there is a g
rowing demand for people who 
can work with analytics and big data. Universities, companies, and vendors are responding in a variety of ways. 
Many universities are adding a required course in analytics (including big data analytics) to their undergraduate 
and 
graduate  programs.  From  a  historical  perspective,  this  is  interesting  for  faculty  in  business  schools  because  most 
business schools used to require a course in management science or quantit
at
ive methods but phased it out when 
the marketplace did not re
quire it. Obviously, businesses now want gra
duates with analytical skills. 
Another   significant   change   is   the   rapid   emergence   of   undergraduate   degree   programs,   certificates,   MBA 
concentrations, and graduate degree programs in analytics. To illustrate the g
rowth in analytics offerings, a survey in 
the 
fall
of
2012  found  59  universities  offering  business  intelligence/business  analytics  degree
s
,  with  22  at  the 
undergraduate  level.  Only  two  years  earlier,  a  similar  survey  found  only  12  schools  that  offered    BI/
BA  degree
s
[Watson, 
Wixom and Ariyachandra
, 2013b]. 
Graduate  analytics  offerings  are  located  across  campus,  including 
in  business,  engineering,  and  s
tatistics.  The 
instructional  delivery  varies  from  on
-
campus  to  online.  One  of  the  first  and  best  known  pro
grams  is  the  Master  of 
Science  in  Analytics  at  North  Carolina  State  University.  SAS  has  been  an  important  contributor  to  the  program, 
which is offered through the Institute for Advanced Analytics and has its own facility on campus. Deloitte Consulting 
part
nered  with  the  Kelly  School  of  Business  at  Indiana  University  to  offer  a  certificate  in  business  analytics  for 
Deloitte’s  professionals.  Last  year,  N
orthwestern  University  initiated  an  online  Master  of  Science  in  Predictive 
Analytics  offered  through  its  Sc
hool  of  Continuing  Studies.  Still  unknown,  however,  is  how  many  students  will 
choose to study big data analytics, because it is an intellectua
lly c
hallenging field of study.
Companies are responding in several ways. One approach is to create educational op
portunities for people who are 
already  on  board  (e.g.,  business  and  BI  analysts)  and  have  the  interest  and  aptitude  to  further  develop  their  skills
through  in
-
house  programs,  conferences,  and  college  courses.  In  the  past,  there  have  been  dire  forecasts  of 
shortages of people with specific skills (even COBOL programmers), and people acquired the needed skills and took 
advantage 
of the opportunities [Healy, 2012]. 
For  companies  that  want  to  hire  data  scientists,  Davenport  and  Patil 
[
2012
]
have  useful  ideas  f
or  how  to  proceed, 
including scanning the membership rolls of user groups dedicated to data science tools like R; looking for them on 
LinkedIn; engaging them at conferences like Strata,  Structure:Data, 
and Hadoop World; and hosting a competition 
on Kaggle 
or TopCoder, the analytics and co
ding sites
